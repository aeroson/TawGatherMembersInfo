# TawGatherMembersInfo
Automatic gathering of TAW.net members information for automated processing purposes. 
Such as automatic generation of Arma 3 squad xmls.

# Arma squad xMLs:

This project provides regulary and automatically generated squad xmls for all of TAW.net Arma members.
Including all members of AM 1 and AM 2.
Squad xmls are thus always up to date (the changes may take up to several hours to propagate).

### What is squad xml

### How to get squad xml
You need to fill in your steam id on your TAW.net profile.
After you fill it, it takes several hours before the system updates it.

# API
This project also provides API to automatically get up to date information of all TAW.net members.
You need to ask AM 2 server staff to give you an authentication token.
The information is however easy to get even without this project for anyone (even not logged in users) at http://taw.net/unit/1/roster.aspx
The resutling list includes all members, even discharged ones, and the order of members always stays the same. New members are added to the bottom.
